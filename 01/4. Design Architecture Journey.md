The design architecture journey goes through these steps:

1. Monolity
2. Layered
3. SOA
4. MicroServices

## Subcomponents of Architecture
- MicroService Communications (Sync / Async)
- Data Management (Database / Query / Commands)
- Patterns & Principles
- Caching
- Deployment

So we can summarize in the below diagram:

## Evolviong the Architecture
The architecture should evolve from the core concepts. This evolution should be guided by these questions
1. How can we scale the application?
2. How many requests do we need to handle?
3. How many seconds of Latency is acceptable in our architecture?
