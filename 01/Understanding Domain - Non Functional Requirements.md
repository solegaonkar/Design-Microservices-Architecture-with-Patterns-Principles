These include all the *ilities

## Scalability
This refers to the ability to grow. The same architecture should be valid even when we grow to a higher volume. 

This means that the application should be based on the right principles. Assumptions are well thought over. Architecture, Design and Code follows the best practices.

## Availability
Availability is important for any enterprise. The application cannot go down. It should be always up and ready to serve. 

This requires elaborate mechanism to ensure that the system does not go down. This has to span over all aspects of the system architecture. Technical architecture is just one of them. 

Availability of the application depends upon the infrastructure, system, data, application architectures. It depends upon the discipline of people maintaining it, as well as the processes set up by the authorities.

## Reliability
This refers to the accuracy of the outcome. The application should be able to perform with zero errors

There is no alternative to a well tested code developed by competent developers - based on crisp design and architecture - enabled by precise requirements. All these contribute towards the reliability of the application.

## Maintainability
Any software requires support, monitoring, and it will change with time. Application is maintainable if it is easier to monitor, fix, and enhance.

This includes some simple practices like properly commenting and documenting the code. That is possible with clarity of design and architecture, and well understood requirements.

## Usability
Technical accuricy is not enough. The end user should find it simple to use. Usability of the application has a direct impact on the bottom line of the application

## Efficiency
Everyone wants a perfect application. But nobody wants to pay for it. Efficiency is the ability to get perfect outputs with minimal inputs.
