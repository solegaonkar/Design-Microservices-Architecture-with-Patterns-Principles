### Monolithic architectures are characterized by
- Single Codebase
- Big Deployments
- Single War/Jar
- Difficult to Manage
- Hard to enhance

### Advantages of Monolithic
- Straightforward to build, test, deploy
- Easier to debug
- Vertical Scale up

Perfect choice if you have a small/simple application

### Disadvantages of Monolith
- Complicated to Understand
- Difficult to make changes
- Barrier to upgrade to new technologies
- Very difficult to scale - when vertical scaling is no longer feasible

## Reference Architectures
Here are some of the reference architectures for monolithic applications

## Monolithic Design Principles
Years of developer experience led to identifying some key principles that can help improve monolithic applications

### DRY
*That is, Don't Repeat Yourself.*

Formally, every piece of information must have a single, unambiguous, authorative representation in the system. That makes it easier to change. Avoid duplication at all cost

### KISS
*Keep It Simple, Stupid*

Try to simplify things. Choose simplicity over complexity. Better names, simpler API's, etc.

### YAGNI
*You Ain't Gonna Need It*

Often we tend to think way ahead in the future, adding more features that we really do not need.
