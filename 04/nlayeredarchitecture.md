## Separation of Concerns
- Elements in the software should be unique, with separate responsibilities
- Each component limits itself to the allocated responsibilities
- Low coupling and high cohesion

## SOLID
- **S**ingle Responsibility
- **O**pen Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### Single Responsibility
Each of the components has a single responsibility, and that component is singly responsible for that functionality.

### Open Closed Principle
Any code should be Open for extension and Closed for modification. It should be implemented in a way that it can be extended without need to modify

### Liskov Substitution Principle
