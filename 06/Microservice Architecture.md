# Microservices

https://medium.com/design-microservices-architecture-with-patterns/microservices-architecture-2bec9da7d42a

## Characteristics of Microservices
- Small, independent, loosely coupled
- Separate codebases
- Deployed independently
- Persist their own data
- Well defined API
- Technology Agnostic

- Small Services
- Running in own Process
- Communicating with API
- Independently Deployable
- Different Programming Language
- Own technology stack
- Decoupled microservices with bounded context

- Componentization via Services
- Organized by Business Capabilities
- Products not Projects
- Smart end points and dumb pipelines
- Decentralized Governance
- Decentralized Data Management
- Infrastructure Automation
- Design for failure


## Benefits of Microservice Architecture
- Agility
- Small focused Teams
- Small, separated codebases
- Right tool for the job
- Adapting technology changes
- Fault isolation
- Scalability
- Data Isolation

## Challenges of Microservice Architecture
- Management complexity. Code is simple, but management is complex because of too many services and code bases
- Network and Latency problems
- Difficult to test end to end
- Data Integrity is a difficult with distributed data

## Database Per Service
- Loose coupling
- Polygot Persistence
- Data protection - it can't be accessed directly
- Scale independently
- Encapsulation
